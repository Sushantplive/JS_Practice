## 🔧 Live Server (recommended) ✅
To preview HTML files with Live Server:

- Install the **Live Server** extension (recommended in `.vscode/extensions.json`).
- Open `Basics/DOMmanipulation.html` → Right-click → **Open with Live Server** or click **Go Live** in the status bar.

**If you're running in a dev container or remote environment:**
- Live Server is configured to bind to `0.0.0.0` and port `5500` by default in this workspace (`.vscode/settings.json`).
- Make sure to forward port **5500** in VS Code's Ports view so you can open the page in your host browser.
<!-- cd /workspaces/JS_Practice && python3 -m http.server 5500 --bind 0.0.0.0 -->

**Fallback (no extension):**
- From the workspace root run: `python3 -m http.server 5500 --bind 0.0.0.0` and open `http://localhost:5500/Basics/DOMmanipulation.html` in your browser.
